    "While looking through the Blog content, I was drawn to the idea of generating my own profile pictur using Dall-E 3. I immediately looked into generating my profile picture through some Python scripts in a notebook, but unfortunately, a lot of the documentation I was reviewing for image generation ended up being outdated (curse you openai updates>=1.0.0). I thought it'd be way cooler to run a blog with code that I personally wrote, but I'll be using Dall-E 3 in OpenAI's native web app with the 4o model."
